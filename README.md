# HuggingFace-Space-Gradio-Tutorial
In this repo, I have built a model using the FASTAI library and showcased  a demo with Gradio, hosting on Hugging Face Spaces. We have used a classic CNN pet classifier as an example. More details on the data can be found here - **https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/**
